COVER

To whom it may concern,

It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for this position. I'm a lead full stack developer working remotely from the pacific northwest. I love building digital experiences, working with big data, and solving complex challenges.

Recently, I've had the privilege of working for a few really cool tech companies in the Pacific Northwest. At Kaspien I helped build inventory management and ad-space software that has driven over 1B in sales. In my current role I work on a SaaS product that has empowered over 1M customers to form/incoporate companies in the US. I am leading a team, defining architecture, and developing innovative solutions using a wide variety of technologies and frameworks.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 
  

Sincerely,  


Evan Daley
